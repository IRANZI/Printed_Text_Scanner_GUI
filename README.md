Printed Text Scanner

The Printed Text Scanner is a lightweight GUI application that extracts text from printed images using PyTesseract. It supports image upload and live camera mode, allowing you to select a specific region and instantly run OCR on it. The app also includes an overlay preview so you can clearly see what text has been detected.

Purpose

This project was developed for an AI Without ML assignment to explore how classical OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems function without relying on machine learning models.

How It Works

Launch the application.

Load an image or activate your camera.

Draw a selection around the area containing text.

The OCR engine processes the selected region.

Extracted text appears instantly inside the GUI.

Demo

A short 20–40 second video demonstrates the app scanning a printed image and displaying the recognized text in real time.
